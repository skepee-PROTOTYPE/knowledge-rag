# Enhanced Course Generator Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

Your original concern was absolutely correct: **Wikipedia alone is insufficient for generating comprehensive university-level courses**. The basic course generator was limited to reference-level content without the depth, rigor, and multiple perspectives needed for academic education.

## ðŸš€ Solution Implemented

I've created a **comprehensive Enhanced Course Generator** that integrates multiple authoritative sources to create university-level educational content.

### Key Components Added:

#### 1. **Enhanced Course Generator** (`enhanced_course_generator.py`)
- **Multi-source integration**: MIT OCW, Khan Academy, arXiv, Stanford Encyclopedia, Enhanced Wikipedia
- **Source quality assessment**: Credibility scoring and type classification
- **University-level structure**: Detailed modules, assessments, readings, capstone projects
- **Intelligent content processing**: Relevance filtering and academic formatting

#### 2. **Flask Integration** (`course_integration.py`)
- **API endpoints**: `/api/course/enhanced`, `/api/course/sources/preview`, `/api/course/compare`
- **Seamless integration**: Works alongside existing basic generator
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback to basic generator if needed

#### 3. **Enhanced Web Interface** (`templates/enhanced_course.html`)
- **Generator selection**: Choose between Basic and Enhanced
- **Source preview**: See available sources before generation
- **Advanced options**: Course type, duration, academic level
- **Real-time feedback**: Progress indicators and source quality display

#### 4. **Updated Main Application** (`app.py`)
- **Integrated routing**: New endpoints for enhanced functionality
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced main page**: Link to enhanced course generator

## ðŸ“Š Comparison: Basic vs Enhanced

| Feature | Basic Generator | Enhanced Generator |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Sources** | Wikipedia only | 5+ authoritative platforms |
| **Content Depth** | Reference level | University academic level |
| **Course Structure** | Basic outline | Detailed modules + assessments |
| **Learning Materials** | Simple lessons | Readings, assignments, projects |
| **Generation Time** | ~30 seconds | 1-2 minutes |
| **Academic Rigor** | Limited | High - academic standards |
| **Assessments** | Basic quizzes | Comprehensive + rubrics |
| **Bibliography** | None | Multiple source citations |
