# Enhanced Course Generator - Configuration Guide

## Overview

The Enhanced Course Generator addresses the limitations of using Wikipedia alone by integrating multiple authoritative sources to create comprehensive university-level courses.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multiple Content Sources
- **MIT OpenCourseWare**: Academic course materials and syllabi
- **Khan Academy**: Educational content and structured lessons  
- **arXiv**: Recent academic papers (for STEM topics)
- **Stanford Encyclopedia**: Authoritative philosophical and humanities content
- **Wikipedia**: Enhanced with better search strategies
- **Coursera**: Public course descriptions and syllabi

### 2. Source Quality Assessment
- Credibility scoring (0.0 to 1.0) for each source
- Source type classification (academic, educational, research, reference)
- Automatic filtering and ranking

### 3. University-Level Content
- Academic rigor appropriate for higher education
- Detailed learning objectives and assessments
- Required readings and bibliography
- Comprehensive assignments and projects
- Capstone project requirements

## Getting Started

1. **Test the System**:
   ```bash
   python test_enhanced_course_generator.py
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access Enhanced Generator**:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:5000/enhanced-course`
   - Or click "Enhanced Course Generator" from main page

4. **Try Sample Topics**:
   - "Machine Learning Ethics"
   - "Quantum Computing"
   - "Philosophy of Mind"
   - "Sustainable Energy Systems"

## Benefits for University-Level Courses

### Content Quality
- Multiple authoritative sources ensure comprehensive coverage
- Academic-level depth appropriate for higher education
- Current research integration through arXiv

### Structure
- Detailed learning objectives aligned with academic standards
- Comprehensive assessment strategies
- Required readings from multiple sources
- Capstone projects for skill application

### Flexibility
- Customizable course length and intensity
- Level-appropriate content generation
- Multiple course format options

## Technical Notes

### Source Integration
The system uses a pluggable architecture where each content source is handled by a dedicated method. This allows for:
- Easy addition of new sources
- Independent source reliability
- Gradual improvement of source integration

### Content Processing
- Intelligent content extraction and summarization
- Relevance scoring and filtering
- Duplicate content detection and removal

### Performance
- Asynchronous source querying (where possible)
- Intelligent caching of source content
- Rate limiting to respect API constraints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No sources found**: Try broader or different keywords
2. **Generation timeout**: Reduce course scope or try basic generator
3. **API limits**: Wait and retry, or use cached content

### Fallback Behavior
- If enhanced sources fail, falls back to Wikipedia-only generation
- Graceful degradation ensures course generation always works
- Clear error messages guide users to alternatives

## Contribution Guide

To add new content sources:
1. Create a new `_search_[source_name]` method
2. Add source type to credibility scoring
3. Update source selection logic
4. Test with representative content

The system is designed to be extensible and maintainable for ongoing improvements.
